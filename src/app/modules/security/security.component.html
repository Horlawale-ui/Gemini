      Our founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, were early investors in
      cryptocurrency and struggled to find a platform where they could securely
      manage their growing portfolio. Out of that frustration and lack of trust,
      they built Gemini to deliver the first trusted platform that focused on
      strong security controls and compliance.

      Today, every employee at Gemini continues our foundersâ€™ focus on security
      and compliance, in order to build trust. Gemini has built a leading
      security program focused on developing innovative security solutions to
      help protect and secure our customers and their assets. We have also
      invested considerable resources to remain transparent about our security
      posture, through third party security assessments, including our SOC2 Type
      2, ISO 27001, and annual penetration testing.
